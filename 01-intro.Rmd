## Background and introduction  {-}

The goal of HydroATLAS is to provide a broad user community with a standardized compendium of 
hydro-environmental attribute information for all watersheds and rivers of the world at high 
spatial resolution. Version 1.0 of HydroATLAS offers data for 56 variables, partitioned into 281
individual attributes and organized in six categories: hydrology; physiography; climate; land cover
& use; soils & geology; and anthropogenic influences (Table 1 and Appendix 1). HydroATLAS 
derives the hydro-environmental attributes by reformatting original data from well-established 
2
global digital maps. The attributes are then linked to hierarchically nested sub-basins at multiple 
scales, as well as to individual river reaches, both extracted from the global HydroSHEDS database 
at 15 arc-second (~500 m) resolution. The sub-basin and river reach information is offered in two 
companion datasets: BasinATLAS and RiverATLAS. The standardized format of HydroATLAS
ensures easy applicability while the inherent topological information supports basic network 
functionality such as identifying up- and downstream connections. HydroATLAS is fully compatible 
with other products of the overarching HydroSHEDS project enabling versatile hydro-ecological 
assessments. Updates of HydroATLAS are envisioned as new data become available.
The HydroATLAS documentation is organized in two parts: Part 1 (this document) provides an 
overview of the database and general explanations. Part 2 is provided in two alternative files:
‘BasinATLAS_Catalog’ or ‘RiverATLAS_Catalog’. Each catalog file first provides a summary table 
listing all hydro-environmental variables and their basic characteristics. This is followed by detailed 
information on each individual variable, including source data descriptions, units, conversion 
methodology, and citations. Each variable is presented on one standardized sheet which includes a 
map at global extent indicating the spatial distribution of values of the respective variable. Note that 
the summary table and information sheets are hyperlinked within each catalog.
The development of HydroATLAS is fully described in Linke et al. (2019). For data citations and

## Methods and data characteristics {-} 

The methods used to create HydroATLAS are fully described in Linke et al. (2019). All spatial units 
of HydroATLAS, i.e. either sub-basin polygons or river reach lines, were extracted from World 
Wildlife Fund’s HydroSHEDS database (Lehner et al. 2008; Lehner and Grill 2013) at a grid 
resolution of 15 arc-seconds (approx. 500 m at the equator). For more information please refer to 
the Technical Documentation of HydroSHEDS at [](http://www.hydrosheds.org).
HydroATLAS consists of two complementary parts: BasinATLAS and RiverATLAS. BasinATLAS 
provides hydro-environmental attributes for sub-basins (polygons). RiverATLAS provides hydro-environmental attributes for stream and river reaches (line segments).
Basin and sub-basin delineations have been pre-processed as a derivative of HydroSHEDS at 15 arc-second resolution and are available as a stand-alone product termed HydroBASINS (for details see [](https://www.hydrosheds.org/page/hydrobasins)). The HydroBASINS dataset offers a suite of 12 
layers, each containing nested sub-basins that were subdivided and coded using the topological 
concept of the Pfafstetter system, which provides a methodology for the breakdown of sub-basins 
at different scales in a hierarchical and systematic manner (Figure 1a). It should be noted, however,that at the lowest Pfafstetter levels (i.e. 1-3) multiple river basins may be lumped into larger regions, and for coastal sub-basins (at any level) multiple smaller rivers may be lumped into one sub-basin—in these cases, the association of some particular attributes (such as river discharge) is ambiguous and the assigned attribute value may refer to only one river within the sub-basin unit.
Also, a global river network delineation has been extracted from HydroSHEDS at 15 arc-second 
resolution and is available as a stand-alone product termed HydroRIVERS (for details see 
[](https://www.hydrosheds.org/page/hydrorivers)). For this network, rivers have been defined to 
start at all pixels where the accumulated upstream catchment area exceeds 10 km2, or where the 
long-term average natural discharge exceeds 0.1 cubic meters per second, resulting in a line 
network consisting of individual stream and river reaches (Figure 1b).

![__Figure 1: Overview of Pfafstetter sub-basin coding scheme used in BasinATLAS (a); and river reach concept used in RiverATLAS (b). Sub-basins are nested within 12 hierarchical levels. A river reach is defined as a stretch between two tributaries, or between the start/end of the network and a tributary.__](pfafstetter.png)

It should be noted that the quality of HydroSHEDS data is significantly inferior for regions above 60 degrees northern latitude as there are no underlying SRTM elevation data available and thus a 
coarser scale DEM has been inserted (HYDRO1k provided by USGS).

### Data format and distribution  {-}

_a) Data format and projection_  

HydroATLAS is publicly available for download at[](http://www.hydrosheds.org/page/hydroatlas)
and from the figshare data repository at[](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.9890531). All map 
data layers, including attribute tables, are provided in ESRI© Geodatabase and Shapefile formats. 
The data are projected in a Geographic Coordinate System using the World Geodetic System 1984 
(GCS_WGS_1984). The attribute table can also be accessed as a stand-alone file in dBASE format 
which is included in the Shapefile format. HydroATLAS data are available electronically in 
compressed zip file format. To use the data files, the zip files must first be decompressed. Each zip file includes a copy of the HydroATLAS Technical Documentation.

_b) Layer name syntax and spatial coverage_

HydroATLAS data layers are provided in two spatial extents:  

* primarily as a seamless, fully global coverages;  
* but for some datasets also (or only) as regional tiles (see Figure 2 for definition of regions).

The layer names follow the syntax: 

* __BasinATLAS_v10_levXX__ (for BasinATLAS layers with global coverage), where XX indicates 
the Pfafstetter level (1-12);
* __RiverATLAS_v10__ (for RiverATLAS layer with global coverage); or
* __RiverATLAS_v10_YY__ (for RiverATLAS layers in regional tiles), where YY indicates the 
region. 

The regional extents are defined by a two-digit identifier:

![](rivers_reg.png)


Note that the Shapefile format is limited to a maximum file size of 2 GB; therefore the RiverATLAS 
data in Shapefile format are only provided in regional tiles (with further subdivisions into north 
and south parts where needed). Currently, all other data layers are provided in full global coverage,but more versatile regional breakdowns and data packages may be offered in future iterations.

![__Figure 2: Spatial extent of regional tiles of HydroATLAS layers.__](spatial_rep.png)


_c) Available columns and column name syntax_    

The attribute tables of HydroATLAS contain the pre-existing columns of HydroBASINS and 
HydroRIVERS, respectively (see their Technical Documentations at [](http://www.hydrosheds.org) for 
details). The hydro-environmental attributes are then appended in a series of additional columns. 
This section provides information on the column name syntax used for the identification of each 
sub-basin or river reach attribute provided in the HydroATLAS database. All existing attributes and 
their associated column names are summarized in Appendix 1 and at the beginning of the 
BasinATLAS and RiverATLAS catalogs.   

Each hydro-environmental attribute column name has 10 digits (for example ‘dis_m3_syr’) and its 
syntax is as follows:

      <Layer name key>_<Unit key>_<Spatial key>< Dimension key>

__Layer name key:__   
Three digits that describe the name of the attribute. The layer name key is unique to the 
attribute it represents. _Example: ‘dis’ for discharge._

__Unit key:__     
Two digits that describe the units of the attribute value. See Table 2 for possible keys.

![](table2_unit_keys.png)

__Spatial extent key:__   
One digit that describes the spatial extent of the attribute. See Table 3 for possible keys.

![](table3_spatial_keys.png)

__Dimension key:__  
Two digits that describe the dimension of the attribute in terms of its aggregation level or other 
type of spatio-temporal association. The dimension key can refer to a temporal dimension, a 
statistical aggregation, or a class or year association. See Table 4 for possible keys.
